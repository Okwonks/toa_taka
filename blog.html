          <h3>Cleaner Tomorrow</h3>
          <p>It has been my desire for the past few years to see a cleaner Nairobi. I came here on holiday once and loved the scenery, however the trash or "taka" was a big problem as I took a city tour. We cannot isolate ourselves from the earth’s natural
            processes and our immediate environment—whether it be natural or built. Every element of our existence is derived from our surroundings. Those elements that constitute our physical form and all living and non-living matter have existed since
            the earth was formed from the sun nearly 4.6 billion years ago.</p>
          <p>As a result, the environment provides man with nourishment and energy. Energy emitted from the sun travels millions of miles to earth, where it is stored in plants through photosynthesis. Along with other essential elements, matter then is transferred
            to man through the food chain.</p>
          <p>And that is my story on my view for the future of cleanliness in regards to the capital. There are also some detrimental factors which I believe the <a href="team.html" title="Know the Team">Toa Taka</a> Team will be very capable to work around
            and bring the change we seek.</p>

          <h3>No Dumping <small>A pesimists story</small></h3>
          <p>People never change. As they were is how they will be now and always. There's nothing new under the sun. The same people who litter yesterday are same one's who will fall ill and complain about cholera and typhoid and all those nasty sicknesses.
            It is as though we do not wish to learn or grow in this life. A simple task as throwing trash in a designated area one fails to do.</p>
          <p>This backward behaviour will be the <span class="text-danger">death</span> of us all. How can we keep doing the same things and expect different results? It is clearly foolishness! When shall we emancipate ourselves from this slavery of the
            mind. We need to break free! we are stuck in an everlasting loop that only we can save ourselves from but we must be willing to be able to Make the changes which are necessary in life.</p>
          <p>Aside from all the pesimistic views I am happy to see the likes of Toa Taka in the country at a time such as this. It is time to put our best foot forward and get to a "taka" free country. Once the momentum is picked nothing will be able to
            stop us we can only move forward from here onwards. The Toa Taka revolution is on it has began and it will bring the change that we have long awaited to see in the "mazingira".</p>
          <p>Clean county is definitely the way to go when it comes to clearing the trash. We should keep up with the good campaign and push the revolution to the world. Though humanity remains the same we have the capability to learn and to grow. Toa Taka
            is a stepping stone towards a higher standard of living, it can and will be attained if can only put aside our flaws and see the rebuild of the future.</p>

          <p>It has been my desire for the past few years to see a cleaner Nairobi. We at Toa Taka have been able to get a few of our leaders to plug in to our cause. This has really help push our agenda forward in the counties and it has allowed for smooth intergration. Since we cannot isolate ourselves from the earth’s natural processes and our immediate environment—whether it be natural or built, we decided to have as much help as we can. Ropping in leaders has been a a huge milestone for
            the <a href="team.html" title="Know more..">Toa Taka team</a>.</p>

Along with other essential elements, matter then is transferred to man through the food chain.</p>
          <p>As our leaders lead, so shall we follow. It is basic mentality and it is great to see the leaders being roped in - such a pleasant surprise. Working with Toa Taka is a great service to the communtiy and the leaders have taken their leadership a step further by being true leaders and helping in serving the people</p>

          <h3>Clean Parks, Happy people</h3>
          <p>The parks are clean and it's going to stay that way! As one of our major projets. We as Toa Taka, embarked on a journey to clean one of our parks. Uhuru park was the goal of the day. We pulled together all our recources and with aid from donors we were able to clean up our city based park at the heart of Nairobi. We were joined by members of the Environment Society in Kenya. It was a delight to be able to work intandem with environment enthusist.</p>
          <p>It remains to be one of our best projects. It was also one of our first and a chance for us as Toa Taka to make an impact on the public domain. We had a huge turn out and all went well. There were educative sessions where the public was taught and public awareness on cleanliness pushed to a whole new level. This was a make or break position for us and it was great to see a few of the national leaders join us and even fund their constituents. This is <a href="gallery.html">Toa Taka</a>.</p>
